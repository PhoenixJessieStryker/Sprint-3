 What happens to the layout when you resize the screen to less than 550 px. How do you think that works?

 Well i Believe it works because the website questions the CSS to change the from its minimum width.
 It's possibly because when we shrink it to that size it is trying to use up all the sapce on the mobile 
 that is acknowledgable .
