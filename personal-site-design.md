What is you site's primary purpose?

to Show other's the experience i have had with EDA and talk alot alot about who i am and what has changed.
This will hopefully give others a starting point to learn HTML faster or maybe just enjoy my relative experiences.

Who is your target audience?

In most cases would be Students of EDA ,However i'd like to take the oppertunity to make something special for both those learning code and those that may want to step outside their comfort zone and explore a new language. Like how i was when i was first introduced to dev academy i started off with Robotics and that was terribly hard ...so to move into coding was a big leap for me and software engineering was an enviromental choice that i had never concidered.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?

Hopefully being able to log in and explore the website,i would like to leave little comment pages so that others can come on over and give feedback or maybe have standardized debates and conversations. I hope to take some of what ive learned through these sprints and put them into this site so that others will be able to see the beautiful of what a small amount of time and effort can bring (hell ...nah im only kidding its quite fun).

How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?

it will take alot of effort to create what i described but i think starting with tidying up my code then moving on towards appearance as well as little animations. If something becomes hard i ahve many others who may have already experienced the same problem.
